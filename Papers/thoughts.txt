“We’re all going to die, all of us. What a circus! That alone should
make us love each other, but it doesn’t. We are terrorized and
flattened by trivialities; we are eaten up by nothing.”
- Charles Bukowski


The positive is the side effect of handling the negative.

What determines your success isn’t “What do you want to enjoy?” The
question is, “What pain do you want to sustain?” The quality of your
life is not determined by the quality of your positive experiences but
the quality of your negative experiences. And to get good at dealing
with negative experiences is to get good at dealing with life.


If the heavens were indeed controlled by whims of gods, then these gods themselves seem under 
the spell of exact mathematical laws.
